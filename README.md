# my_travel_time_analysis
## Project Idea
In this project, I will analyze how departure time and weather conditions impact the travel time between my home and campus and how these factors together influence my stress levels. My goal is to maintain a positive mood by achieving better time management as a result of this analysis. Weather and departure time will have a considerable impact on travel time. In particular, rush hour and bad weather might increase the time spent, whereas they can also lead to higher stress levels during the trip.


### Description of Dataset
-**Total Duration of each trip**: I will record the travel time provided by Google Maps under “My Timeline”.

-**Stress levels**: My mood will be checked before and after the trip from the Health Monitor app of Samsung to assess how stress levels correlate with the travel experience.

-**Route**: Recording the departure point and the arrival point.

-**Weather**: Weather information will be gathered for each journey by OpenWeatherMap API.

-**Departure time**: The exact time of my departure to analyze its effect on the duration of the trip.

-**Day of the week including the date**: Information to distinguish whether the journey happened on a weekday or weekend.


### Plan
-**Data Collection**:


	- Data will be collected throughout December, maintaining :
 
		- A consistent route.
  
		- The same vehicle.
  
  		- The same driver (myself).

    
	- Travel time will be recorded from Google Maps under “My Timeline.”
 
 
	- Weather data will be obtained using the OpenWeatherMap API.
 
 
	- Stress levels will be monitored using the Samsung Health Monitor app.
 
 
	- To ensure consistency and minimize bias:
 
		- Information will be recorded immediately after each trip.
  
		- Data will be systematically organized and accessible.
  
  
	-Confounding variables and outliers will be carefully considered to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

 
-**Data Preparation and Analysis**:

	- At the end of the data collection period:
 
		- Data will be reviewed for completeness and consistency.

  
	- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 
		- Trends will be identified using statistical and visualization techniques.

  
	- Regression Analysis:
 
		- Statistical methods will be applied to investigate the impact of various factors (departure time, weather, etc.) on travel duration and stress levels.
